# pdjr-skplugin-solarhotwater

Controller for solar powered hot water generation

## Description

**pdjr-skplugin-solarhotwater** implements a simple algorithm which
outputs a binary control signal dependent upon the output of some
power source and a connected battery's state of charge.

The plugin was developed so that surplus energy from a small solar
power array could be used to electrically heat a thermal store; other
applications are, of course, possible.

The plugin operates by monitoring the instantaneous battery SOC and
solar power output.
These readings are compared to configured thresholds and used to
modulate the value of a binary output key which can be used to control
some target device.

## Configuration

The plugin recognises the following configuration properties.

Property                 | Description | Default value
:----------------------- | :--- | ---
enablepath               | Signal K path which indicates whether or not the plugin should operate (value = 1 says 'yes', value = '0' says 'no') | 'control.solarhotwater.enabled'
outputpath               | Signal K path which will have its value set to 1 when water heating should be ON and 0 when heating should be OFF. | 'control.solarhotwater.output'
batterysocpath           | The Signal K path which reports battery SOC. | ''
batterysocstartthreshold | The SOC at which the controller should start heating (if other conditions are met). | 1.0
batterysocstopthreshold  | The SOC at which the controller should stop heating. | 0.95
solarpowerpath           | The Signal K path which reports solar output in Watts. | ''
solarpowerthreshold      | The solar panel output in Watts above which heating should be allowed. | 400

## Operation

1. The plugin heater control output is set to OFF (0) on startup.

2. The value of *enablepath* is a remote-control that determines
   whether (1) or not (0) the plugin should be enabled.
   Typically this value will be modulated by some external control
   interface.

3. Whilst *enablepath* is 1, the plugin checks the value on
   *batterysocpath* to see if it is above *batterysocstartthreshold*
   and if so, heater control is allowed and will remain allowed until
   the value on *batterysocpath* falls below *battersocstopthreshold*.

4. If heater control is both enabled and allowed, then the value on
   *solarpowerpath* is checked to see if it is greater than *solarpowerthreshold*
   and if so, *outputpath* is set to 1, otherwise 0.

In summary, with the plugin enabled, if the battery SOC is 100% and
solar output is sufficient, then heating will commence.
